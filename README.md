We show the codes for the small case in Section 2.1.1.
Parameter.md introduces some parameters to you.
TA-LTT.py, DR-LTT.py, and SC-LTT.py store the Python source codes for generating TA-LTT, DR-LTT, and SC-LTT, respectively.
Results.md shows the optimization results to you.
It is worth noting that although our passenger flow data is randomly generated, however, for your convenience, we only show a set of data that matches the results in Section 2.1.1.
OD_NUMBER.csv shows the number of passengers per OD pair within the Chengdu metro network during the end of the operation period obtained by merging the OD pairs, where the rows from top to bottom represent the origin stations from O1 to O42, and the columns from left to right represent the destination stations from D1 to D41. Note that all OD pairs with O42 as the origin station are multimodal OD pairs and attempt their initial transfer at station s18.
