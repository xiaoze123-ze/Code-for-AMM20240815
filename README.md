# Code-for-AMM20240815
We show the codes for the small case in Section 2.1.1.
Parameter.md introduces some parameters to you, and TA-LTT.py, DR-LTT.py, and SC-LTT.py store the Python source codes for generating TA-LTT, DR-LTT, and SC-LTT, respectively.
It is worth noting that although our passenger flow data is randomly generated, however, for your convenience, we only show a set of data that matches the results in Section 2.1.1.
